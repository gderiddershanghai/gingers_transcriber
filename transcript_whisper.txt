During the summer holiday, I went to a well-known coastal city, Sanya. We checked into a hot local hotel called Atlantis. Among all the shopping malls, aquariums, beaches, and swimming pools, the water world was the most attractive. And one of my scariest experiences happened in this water theme park. On the second day we came to Atlantis, Big Sissy and I went to Water World. I went snorkeling in a shark tank and played on a roller coaster. When we finally headed to the hotel, Big Sissy suddenly said, Let's try the leap of the sea god before we leave. It's a pity not to give it a try.
